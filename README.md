As part of this project, I designed the entire frontend using simple HTML and CSS. I chose to work with basic HTML and CSS because I already had strong experience and confidence in these technologies from previous frontend projects.

Currently, I’m also learning Tailwind CSS and React Native, and I plan to recreate this frontend using those technologies in the future. I’m continuously working on improving my skills and expanding my knowledge over time.

For this project, I organized my codebase with two main folders: one for CSS (where all the styling is maintained) and another for images (used throughout the design). The website consists of five pages, each designed with a focus on clean structure and visual appeal.

Throughout this process, I learned a lot about how to divide a website into well-structured sections, apply spacing effectively using margin and padding, and enhance the overall look and feel. I tackled each section part by part, which helped me manage the design process more efficiently.

Although I faced several challenges—especially with spacing and styling—I resolved them by researching solutions, practicing consistently, and applying the right tools wherever needed. I also added comments throughout the CSS to ensure the code is easy to understand for others.

One of my main takeaways was how to make a website responsive. I put in extra effort to ensure the design adapts well to different screen sizes. This project greatly improved my hands-on experience and problem-solving skills.

While I recognize there are still areas for improvement, I’ve already noted them down and will work on them in my next projects. I genuinely enjoy learning and have a strong passion for frontend development. My goal is to polish my skills and grow further in this field.

I hope this project gives you a clear view of my dedication, creativity, and willingness to learn. I would truly appreciate the opportunity to work with your team. If you find any areas for improvement, I’d be grateful for your feedback so I can keep growing.

I’m genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and showcase my skills. I would love the chance to work with your company and grow under your guidance. If given the opportunity, I assure you that I will dedicate myself fully and will not disappoint.

I believe every suggestion is a chance to learn and improve. I’m confident that, with your support, I can continue to strengthen my abilities and deliver meaningful results.
